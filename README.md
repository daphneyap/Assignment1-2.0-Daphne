<h1> Air League Band (气运联盟）</h1>

<p> My project is creating a fan website, also known as a fansite, for the Chinese Pop Band named Air League. This website will contain different information about the band and of the members, and also include the videos and performances they have.
</p>

<p> With these content, the website serves as a platform for newer fans to get to know more about the band, and hopefully it will answer some of their questions and curiosities about the band!
</p>

<h2> Design Process </h2>

<p> When I first thought of creating a website for a band, I knew that I wanted my website to be a platform for newer fans or people interested about the band, to be able to know more about the band through the use of my website. Thus, I created this website with a focus on an audience filled with newer fans.
</p>

<p> Since newer fans may not know much about the band, but they are very interested and eager to know more, I feel that my website will be able to help them achieve that as the content is catered towards newer fans, and provides sufficient amount of information for them to know more about the band.
</p>
  
<p> For my wireframes and planning, the files will be submitted under Assignment 1 in Brightspace.
</p>

<h2> Features </h2>

<p> Home Page: The page that includes the navigation bar and a carousel of pictures of the band.
</p>

<p> Band Page: The page which shows a summary of the band, and the personal information of the members.
</p>

<p> Video Page: The page which contains the videos of the band's music and performances.
</p>

<p> Music Page: The page which showcases the band's discography.
</p>

<p> The Coming One, Superband Page: The page which contains all the episodes of the show (The show which Air League was formed on).
</p>

<h2> Technologies Used </h2>

<ul>
<li> Adobe XD </li>
<p> To create the wireframe of the website. </p>

<li> HTML </li>
<p> To code out the structure for the website. </p>

<li> CSS </li>
<p> To code out the aesthetics for the website. </p>

<li> Pinterest </li>
<p> To find pictures for the website. </p>
<p> https://www.pinterest.com/

<li> Weibo </li>
<p> To also find pictures for the website. </p>
<p> https://m.weibo.cn/ </p>
</ul>
  
<h2> Testing </h2>

<p> My project will look best on a desktop screen. The content of my website will be evenly spaced out on the desktop screen and users will be able to navigate around the website much easier. On a mobile screen, the content of my website will be compressed into a smaller screen size. Hence, the content of my website might be a bit more cramped on a mobile screen size, while keeping the aesthetics of it.
</p>

<p> I would not call this problem interesting but I would say that trying to code out the website to fit a smaller screen size was a bit of a struggle. I found it a bit hard as I had to go back to my code and actually fully understand what it does so that I know how to code out for a responsive screen size. One example would be the Video, Music, and Superband page. As these pages are filled with pictures and videos, I had to find a way on how to display the pictures and videos in a vertical way on a smaller screen size, and not having them overlapping each other. On top of displaying the pictures and videos vertically, I also had to make the texts fit into the smaller screen size, while its still readable and corresponding to their respective pictures or videos.
