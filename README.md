<h1> Air League Band (气运联盟）</h1>

<p> My project is creating a fan website, also known as a fansite, for the Chinese Pop Band named Air League. This website will contain different information about the band and of the members, and also include the videos and performances they have.
</p>

<p> With these content, the website serves as a platform for newer fans to get to know more about the band, and hopefully it will answer some of their questions and curiosities about the band!
</p>

<h2> Design Process </h2>

<p> When I first thought of creating a website for a band, I knew that I wanted my website to be a platform for newer fans or people interested about the band, to be able to know more about the band through the use of my website. Thus, I created this website with a focus on an audience filled with newer fans.
</p>

<p> Since newer fans may not know much about the band, but they are very interested and eager to know more, I feel that my website will be able to help them achieve that as the content is catered towards newer fans, and provides sufficient amount of information for them to know more about the band.
